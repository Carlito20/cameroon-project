        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          American Select Market was born from a simple idea: to provide quality essential goods
          to families in Cameroon by leveraging our connections in North America.
          With partners in the USA and Canada, we have direct access to
          trusted suppliers and quality products.
        </p>
        <p>
          We focus on the essentials - the products that people need every day to maintain 
          hygiene, comfort, and basic living standards. From personal care items to household 
          cleaning supplies, baby products to health and wellness items, we carefully select 
          and import products that meet the fundamental needs of Cameroonian families.
